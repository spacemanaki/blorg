I had said that learning Haskell would be an interesting diversion from
Scheme (it has been), and mentioned Haskell's lazy evaluation. When I
wrote that I meant in contrast to Scheme's strict evaluation, because I
thought that was the strategy that Scheme uses, which is true: that's
the default in Scheme. However while browsing the Haskell tag on Stack
Overflow, I came across a comment which lead me to search for "Scheme
lazy evaluation" and to reading about delaying evaluation with the
"delay" keyword, as well as creating a thunk by passing a function
literal which will evaluate the expression you want to delay when it is
called.

Here's a clear example from StackOverflow:

[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/925365/what-is-a-thunk-as-used-in-scheme-o...](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/925365/what-is-a-thunk-as-used-in-scheme-or-in-general/925478#925478)

Speaking of SO, here's a really tremendous answer to one of the
many "how to I learn language X" in regards to Haskell:

[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1012573/how-to-learn-haskell/1016986\#1016986](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1012573/how-to-learn-haskell/1016986#1016986)

Such a trove of links and resources. While browsing SO I also discovered
that one of the author's of Real World Haskell is really active on the
site, which is awesome.
