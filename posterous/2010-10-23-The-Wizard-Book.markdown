I just finished watching the the first lecture from the Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs chapter on streams (chapter 3,
section 5). I felt compelled to post and once again highlight my naivete
when I wrote about Haskell's laziness compared to Scheme, because the
lecture (and the chapter in the text, I'm sure. I'm about to sit down
for the reading.) discusses the implementation of lazily evaluated
streams of data.

SICP is a fascinating book. It's so good, it makes me want to press it
into freshman CS students' and fellow Blub programmers' hands. I know
MIT has moved their introductory course to robotics and Python, and I
won't attempt to judge them for it, but the book and lectures are still
incredibly engaging. I wish I had found it sooner, when I was still a
student, but I guess it's better late than never. Maybe the reason I'm
so enthralled with it is exactly because I went through a rather
mundane, Java-centric curriculum. Anyway, if anyone is reading this and
has been on the fence about reading SICP, here's another Internet soul
urging you to just go start. You have no excuse: it's
[free](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)!
